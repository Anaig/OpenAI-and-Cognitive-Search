# Set-up the OpenAI custom skillet

1. In the Azure Portal, get your Azure OpenAI key under the *Keys and Endpoint* section of the resource. Save it for later use.

2. In the [OpenAI studio](https://oai.azure.com/), access the playground, go to *Deployments* and create a new deployment with the model of your choice. Save the model name for later use.

3. Open the [open-ai-custom-skill](../openai-custom-skill) folder and open it in Visual Studio Code.

4. Run the `func init` command in the terminal. You will get a new configuration files *local.settings.json*. You just need to run this command once, to get all the necessary Functions settings in your folder.

5. Update *local.settings.json* with the following parameters:

   ```json
   { 
   	"IsEncrypted": false,
   
        "Values": {
   
           "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "python",
   
           "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
   
           "AZURE_OPENAI_SECRET": "[YOUR_AZURE_OPEN_AI_KEY]",
   
           "OPENAI_ENGINE": "[YOUR_OPEN-AI_MODEL]"
   
           }
   }
   ```

   The `OPENAI_ENGINE` parameter is your model deployment name in Azure OpenAI.

6. Update the [\_\_init\_\_.py](../openai-custom-skill/summarize/__init__.py) function file by updating the global variables `OPENAI_ENDPOINT` and `OPENAI_PROMPT` with your Azure OpenAI endpoint and the prompt you would like to apply to the text of your documents.

7. Use the `func start` command in the command line to test locally. A local endpoint must appear at the end of the output.

8. Use this endpoint to make a `POST` Rest call with the following body format, which is the format of an [array of record](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-custom-skill-interface#format-web-api-inputs) from Cognitive Search :

```json
{
    "values": [
      {
        "recordId": "0",
        "data": {
            "id": "1",
            "lang": "en",
            "text": "[SOME_TEST_TEXT]"
        }
      }
    ]
}
```

9. Deploy the function to Azure using `func azure functionapp publish <YOUR_FUNCTION_APP_NAME>`.  Don't forget to copy the environment variables from *local.settings.json* to your application settings.
10. Save your function endpoint to use it in the Cognitive Search script.



You can create as many Functions as Custom Skills you want. Just copy the current function folder or create a new folder under `open-ai-custom-skill`, named by the function you would like to create, that contains a `__init__.py` and a `function.json` file.

If you are facing any issue, refer to the [Getting started with Azure Functions](../openai-custom-skill/getting_started_with_azure_functions.md) documentation.
